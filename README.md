## Project Overview

## Dataset

## Data Collection and Pre-processing
- Perform initial data loading, cleaning, and exploration tasks on national and subnational tree cover loss data in Kenya. 
- Rename columns for clarity, remove unnecessary columns, and check the distribution of key variables like threshold.
  The cleaned data can now be used for further analysis or modeling.

## Project Overview

## Dataset

## Data Collection and Pre-processing
- Perform initial data loading, cleaning, and exploration tasks on national and subnational tree cover loss data in Kenya. 
- Rename columns for clarity, remove unnecessary columns, and check the distribution of key variables like threshold.
  The cleaned data can now be used for further analysis or modeling.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
**1. Trend Analysis of Tree Cover Loss:**

- Plots the trend of tree cover loss from 2001 to 2023 across different regions and canopy cover thresholds.
- Highlights the significant reduction in tree cover loss in 2020-2022, likely due to a logging ban, followed by a spike in 2023 after the ban was lifted.

**2.Threshold Distribution Comparison:**

- Creates pie charts comparing the distribution of canopy cover thresholds between the years 2001 and 2023.
- Shows an overall increase in tree cover loss across all thresholds over the last 13 years.

**3. Regional Trend Analysis for Specific Thresholds:**

- Plots the trend of tree cover loss for specific regions (Meru, Kericho, Kiambu) at selected canopy cover thresholds (75%, 25%, 50%).
- Illustrates how tree cover loss varies in these regions over the years.

**4. Comparison of Tree Cover Loss in Nakuru and Kiambu:**

- Compares the tree cover loss between Nakuru and Kiambu over the last 10 years for a 20% canopy cover threshold.
- Concludes that Nakuru has seen greater tree cover loss than Kiambu, though the loss has decreased significantly in the last 5 years.

**5. Top 10 Regions in Tree Cover Loss:**

- Identifies and plots the top 10 regions with the highest tree cover loss over the last 10 years for a 20% canopy cover threshold.
- Narok emerges as the most impacted region, likely due to logging or conversion of forested land to agriculture.

**6. Regions with Greatest Tree Cover Loss Reduction:**

- Highlights the top 10 regions that have seen the greatest reduction in tree cover loss over the last 10 years.
- Coastal regions like Kilifi, Kwale, and Lamu show significant reductions due to mangrove rehabilitation, farm forestry, and community efforts.

Overall, we get a comprehensive analysis of tree cover loss trends across different regions and canopy cover thresholds in Kenya, with a focus on understanding the factors contributing to changes in forest cover over time.
